      <br /><br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          General:
          <ul>
            <li>something went wrong, reload the page to start over</li>
            <li>check server out or logs for errors</li>
            <li>~/.ungitrc must contain valid JSON. Minimal valid json is "{}"</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Connection Lost:
          <ul>
            <li>check status of server or network connection to the ungit server</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Ad Blockers and Privacy Extensions:
          <ul>
            <li>
              add ungit server url to adblocker exception (with port definition) or disable for a
              while
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Git does not have enough permissions:
          <ul>
            <li>check if you could write to .git directory (preferably on unix systems)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

              Find or report bug at
              <a href="https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit/issues">ungit github</a>.<br />
              Just common sense; do a quick search before posting, someone might already have
              created an issue (or resolved the problem!).<br />
              If you're posting a bug; try to include as much relevant information as possible
              (ungit version, node and npm version, os, any git errors displayed, output from cli
              console and output from the browser console).
